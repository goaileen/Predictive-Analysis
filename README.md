# Predictive-Analysis
The aim of this project is to create a model that can predict the outcome of either a binary or a multiclass target variable.

Dataset: CDC diabetes data: With a set of features (IV), you are meant to predict the chances that a set of people have diabetes or not. Here is the link to the full documentation of the data.

Your major task is grouped into two. First, build a multivariate logistic regression with a minimum of three predictor variables using the statmodel library. Explain why you chose the variables and interpret the result. Second, Build the same model (the same variables) using sklearn library to predict the target variable Remember to also report your model evaluation metrics. In carrying out the task, you are expected to include at least three different visualizations either as descriptive or result presentation.
